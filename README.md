1. What is this?
This repository gathers the scripts I employed to conduct data analysis for my Bachelor Thesis Research (BTR) titled "Unraveling the impact of aging on Parkinsonâ€™s Disease-derived Neuroepithelial Stem Cells" in the Maastricht Science Programme (MSP). By automating various steps and standardizing the analytical process, these scripts ensure that the analysis is reproducible and can be uniformly applied to all samples.

2. Topics 
It primarily involves MMqPCR analysis to assess the telomere length based on the Cq values. Two scripts were made based from two differnt protocols: Cawthon (2009) and Martin et al. (2024). The one that was finally used was the one based on Cawthon (2009). Additionally, there is a separate script that plotted the efficiency curves of the primers used. 

3. How to run the scripts
The Scripts were written in Python 3.12.5. And the required libraries can be installed using
